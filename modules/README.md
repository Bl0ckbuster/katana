# Overview of Samurai Modules

Samurai Modules are the tools and targets that can be installed and used on the Samurai Web Testing Framework. A *Tool Module* is a binary or library that can be installed, uninstalled, and possibly executed. A *Target Module* is different in that it behaves like a service. It can be started, stopped, restarted, and has a run status.
